ESP32 Rover ðŸ¤–

This is a 3D-printed rover controlled by an ESP32. It uses a simple web page for remote control and a smartphone for the camera and remote access.

How It Works

    The rover is built with 3D-printed parts from this Thingiverse project.

    An ESP32 hosts a simple webpage to drive the rover's motors.

    The smartphone acts as the camera and a server. It runs:

        An Nginx reverse proxy to handle requests.

        An IP Camera App to stream video.

        A VPN so you can control the rover from anywhere with a phone signal.
